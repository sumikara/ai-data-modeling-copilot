# Expected Semantic Behavior: case_05_noisy_event_log

## Purpose
Case for noisy_event_log.

## Expected JSON behavior
`requires_human_decision` must remain true and confidence should stay low/medium.

## Expected reasoning

## What would count as a failure
- Overconfident unsupported grain
- SQL/DDL generation
- Missing risk discussion
- `requires_human_decision=false`
